# Brazilian Freelancer Data Analysts at Marketplace A

> How much a Brazilian freelancer Data Analyst can earn in a marketplace?

Such question was answered with real data (a sample of 101 active Brazilian freelancer Data Analysts) manually collected from Marketplace A (name omitted intentionally). The solution was carefully planned to answer this question by using Google Spreadsheets, Python (via Google Colab), and Google Data Studio. Indeed, the deployment was the attached dashboard, which was my first dashboard with [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/s/gBqM5RTHvpE). Some assumptions for the analysis:

 * The earnings data are recent (in a yearly basis) - I do not have information about freelancing time on the marketplace;
 * The Data Analyst sample uses the marketplace for extra-income purposes.
