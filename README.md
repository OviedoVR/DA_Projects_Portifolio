Projects:

## 1. Data-driven solution for Brazilian Real Estate Investment Funds (FIIs)

> The project depolyed a **data-driven solution** for analyzing and getting opportunities of Brazilian Real Estate Investment Funds (known as FIIs from Brazilian portuguese - *Fundos de Investimento ImobiliÃ¡rio*). The deployed web-app has two main functionalities: (i) an interactive ranking of FIIs; (ii) an opportunity filter for FIIs that is based on a sector-related strategy. The active prices and indicator is updated on a daily basis. Hence, the **FIIs solution** could be used **to assist** in strategic investment **decisions**.

## 2. Patient missed appointments (Exploratory Data Analysis)

> Why are patients missing appointments in a Podiatry Clinical Network? (an Exploratory Data Analysis)

> A network of clinics specializing in Podiatry (medicine field associated with foot, ankle, and lower extremity) wishes to decrease the rate of missed appointments at its clinic locations. To make strategic decisions, the group needs to know why patients are missing appointments and draw suggestions to solve that problem.  

> The findings and suggestions for this business problem were shared on [Medium](https://medium.com/@vo.freelancer5/exploring-patient-appointments-on-a-podiatry-clinical-network-62beef32f752)

## 3. Brazilian Freelancer Data Analysts at Marketplace A

> How much a Brazilian freelancer Data Analyst can earn in a marketplace?

> Such question was answered with real data (a sample of 101 active Brazilian freelancer Data Analysts) manually collected from Marketplace A (name omitted intentionally). The solution was carefully planned to answer this question by using Google Spreadsheets, Python (via Google Colab), and Google Data Studio. Indeed, the deployment was the attached dashboard, which was my first dashboard with [Google Data Studio](https://datastudio.google.com/s/gBqM5RTHvpE). Some assumptions for the analysis:

 * The earnings data are recent (in a yearly basis) - I do not have information about freelancing time on the marketplace;
 * The Data Analyst sample uses the marketplace for extra-income purposes.
