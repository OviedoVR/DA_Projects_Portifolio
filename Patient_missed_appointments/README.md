# Patient Missed Appointments on a Podiatry Clinical Network

A network of clinics specializing in Podiatry (medicine field associated with foot, ankle, and lower extremity) wishes to decrease the rate of missed appointments at its clinic locations. To make strategic decisions, the group needs to know why patients are missing appointments and draw suggestions to solve that problem. 

The possible outcomes for appointments are:

- Completed
- Rescheduled
- Canceled
- No-Show (patient did not appear and not contacted the clinic

The main findings and conclusions were posted on [Medium](https://medium.com/@vo.freelancer5/exploring-patient-appointments-on-a-podiatry-clinical-network-62beef32f752)
